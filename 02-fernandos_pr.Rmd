## Load libraries and data

```{r libraries, message=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(readxl)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(RColorBrewer)

```

The data for this story came from the New Zealand Education Ministry's statistics repository, [educationcounts.co.nz](https://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/statistics/tertiary-education/participation)

There is a lot of information encoded in the first rows, but it's hard to extract it because the cells are merged. For this particular dataset an easier approach is to read data and headers independently.

```{r data}
data_source <- "Provider-based-enrolments-predominant-field-of-study-2017-final.xlsx"

majors <- read_excel(path = data_source, 
                     sheet = 8,
                     # for the data we skip the first rows
                     skip = 5, 
                     # we will construct column names ourselves
                     col_names = FALSE)

headers <- read_excel(path = data_source, 
                        sheet = 8, 
                        skip = 2,
                        n_max = 3, 
                        col_names = FALSE) 
```

## Tidying data

It is much easier to manage the data if the data frame is "tall" from the beginning. This is because that way it's not necessary to enter any name or row number manually. 

To have a tidy data frame from the beginning we leverage the power of the function `na.locf` from the `zoo` package. This function fills NA values (that arise from the merged cells in Excel) with the last non-NA cell before. First we use it across rows to create consistent column names, and then across cols to fill the field of study.

```{r tidying}
# create column names based on the headers which contains info in qualification type, level and year
column_names <- headers %>% 
  select(-c(1:3)) %>% 
  # fill empty cells with the previous non-na value
  apply(1, zoo::na.locf) %>% 
  as_data_frame() %>%
  # put them togetger
  unite("x", V1:V3) 

# assign column names to the majors data frame
colnames(majors) <- c("field_broad", "field_narrow", "field_detailed", column_names$x)

# tidy qualifications
majors <- majors %>%
  # gather all columns except the ones that describe the field
  gather("qualification", "Students", -contains("field")) %>% 
  # separate the qualification information into columns
  separate("qualification", c("qual_level", "qual_type", "Year"), sep = "_")
  
majors <- majors %>%
  # Select only columns for students at bachelor degree level and higher
  filter(qual_level %in% c("Bachelors degrees", "Honours & postgrad. cert/dips.", "Masters", "Doctorates")) %>%
  # Remove unneeded rows
  filter(!is.na(Students))

# Tidy up variable names
majors <- majors %>% 
  mutate_at(vars("field_broad", "field_narrow"), zoo::na.locf, na.rm = F) %>% 
  # because of the way we did things we need to remove the ": Total" string from
  # the fields
  mutate_at(vars("field_broad", "field_narrow"), sub, pattern = ": Total", replacement = "")

# Remove totals and subtotal
majors <- majors %>%
  filter(!is.na(field_detailed)) %>%
  # Don't need narrow field column
  select(-field_narrow) %>%
  # not interested in differences between domestic or international
  filter(qual_type == "Total") %>%
  select(-qual_type)
```

## Create tall data

```{r tall data}
# It's all done :) no need to anything manually, just need to rename the columns so they match the names you gave them so the rest of the code works 
majors_taller <- majors %>%
  rename(Major = field_detailed, 
         Field.of.study = field_broad)
```

## Create dataframes for visualisation

To visualise data, I go one step further and combine the year columns to create tidy data that can be used to calculate/visualise data for all students. I repeated the process for the humanities, first filtering majors_tall to only include majors ('detailed field of study' on the original Excel sheet) that RNZ deemed to be unambiguously 'humanities' majors - all of them within the 'Society and Culture' field of study category.

The exclusions included:

* Creative Arts majors, which, while often closely related to the humanities, tended to be either more vocational (eg journalism) or normally studied as a degree other than a BA (eg music).
* Economics and econometrics, which can be studied as arts, science or commerce majors, but anecdotally, from talking to academics and students, is predominantly taken as a commerce major.
* Many 'caring' subjects that were strongly linked to a particular vocation
* Law - included in the 'Society and Culture' field but has its own degree and a specific vocation.
* English for Speakers of Other Languages
* Sports-related subjects
* A small number of subjects that were tied to vocational qualifications (eg Librarianship and Information Management)

The filtered data kept four variables where the student's predominant area of study fell within a broad humanities category but was deemed "nec, mixed or nfd" - mixed, not elsewhere classified, or not further defined.

```{r taller data}

humanities_taller <- majors_taller %>% 
  filter(Field.of.study == "Society and Culture") %>% 
  select(-Field.of.study) %>% 
  filter(Major %in% c("Political Science", "Policy Studies", "Sociology", "Anthropology", "History", "Art History", "Archaeology", "Classics", "Human Geography", "Women's Studies", "Studies in Human Society nec, mixed or nfd", "Behavioural Science nec, mixed or nfd", "Curatorial Studies", "English Language", "Criminology", "Te Reo Maori", "Foreign Languages", "Linguistics", "Literature", "Language and Literature nec, mixed or nfd", "Philosophy", "Religious Studies", "Community, Whanau, Family and Consumer Studies", "Cultural Studies", "Society and Culture nec, mixed or nfd"))
```

# Visualise change in humanities numbers

```{r overall-decline}

# Summarise by year

humanities_drop <- humanities_taller %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>% 
  summarise(Students = sum(Students))

# Line graph of overall change in humanities student numbers year by year

ggplot(humanities_drop, aes(x=Year, y=Students, group=1)) +

```

# Visualise biggest changes in major

There were changes to student enrolments in almost every subject, but to show those with the biggest impact, we've limited this graphic to the 10 largest +/- changes, by raw student numbers. It's possible to visualise this by the largest percentage changes, but some of those changes happened within subjects with very low numbers of students. However, I've left in the code to create this column.

```{r biggest-change}

# Merge the different levels of study, filter out the non-specific variables and arrange from biggest gain to biggest loss 

all_levels <- humanities_taller %>% 
  group_by(Major, Year) %>% 
  summarise(Students = sum(Students)) %>%

  spread("Year", "Students") %>% 
  mutate(Gap=`2017`-`2008`) %>% 
  mutate(percent_change=Gap/`2008`*100) %>% 
  filter(!(Major %in% c("Studies in Human Society nec, mixed or nfd", "Behavioural Science nec, mixed or nfd", "Language and Literature nec, mixed or nfd", "Society and Culture nec, mixed or nfd"))) %>% 
  arrange(Gap)

all_levels$Major <- factor(all_levels$Major, levels=unique(all_levels$Major))

#Top Ten +/- change

all_levels_ten <- all_levels %>%
